### About Wargus

Wargus is a Warcraft 2 Mod that allows you to play Warcraft 2 with the Stratagus
engine. The game looks and sounds almost exactly like Warcraft 2.  The gameplay
is very close to Warcraft 2's gameplay, with slight enhancements towards
Starcraft and other more modern RTS games.

### Installation

On first launch you will be asked for a copy of the original Warcraft2, so that
the installer can extract the data.  There's also [a video
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnY13i105LE&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}
on how to install Wargus.

### The benefits of Wargus over original Warcraft 2

* You can play on different operating systems like Linux, MacOS X, and Windows.
* Play in high resolution, with OpenGL shaders to improve or change the visuals.
* Local and Online multiplayer.
* You can tweak many of the game's parameters using the Lua language.
* You can set game parameters right from the command line

### Disclaimer

Wargus is not an official Blizzard product, it's a Warcraft 2 modification, by
