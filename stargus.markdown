### About Stargus

Stargus is a Stratagus Mod that allows you to play Starcraft with the Stratagus
engine. The game is currently in pre-alpha, with not much development happening
(help appreciated). Right now, Terran and most Zerg units work, with Protoss
being less complete. Many of the special features are not implemented, such as
flying Terran buildings, Zerg creep, or Protoss shields. Many animations are
also missing. The campaign is not being worked on at all.


However, the game is already fun in skirmish battles Terran on Terran.


The game currently looks like this: ![](img/screenshotStargus.png)


### Installation

During the first launch of Stargus you will be asked for the location of the
original Starcraft CD or installation folder, so that the installer can extract
the data. Not all versions of Starcraft currently work, with installation
folders tending to work better than CDs.


### Disclaimer

Stargus is not an official Blizzard product, its a Stratagus modification using
Starcraft data, by Starcraft fans for Starcraft fans. You need a copy of the
original Starcraft to play.  Starcraft is a registered trademark of Blizzard
Entertainment.

Stargus is an open source software. It is developed at
