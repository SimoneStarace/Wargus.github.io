### Stratagus for a regular user
Stratagus is a sotware that will be installed for you automatically by
Wargus or other game that requires it.

### Stratagus for a developer
Stratagus is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming engine. It
includes support for playing over the internet/LAN, or playing a computer
opponent. The engine is configurable and can be used to create games with a
wide-range of features specific to your needs. Stratagus is written in C++. You
can download Stratagus from [GitHub](https://github.com/Wargus/stratagus){:target="_blank"}

### Development

Stratagus is an open source software. It is developed at
[![](img/github.svg)GitHub](https://github.com/Wargus/wargus){:target="_blank"}
where you can submit bugs, request features and observe progress via issues.

We have an [index](/lua_bindings.html) of exported Lua functions and the
associated documentation, which is of interest if you want to work on the game
lua scripts.

We have [doxygen code documentation](/doxygen/index.html), which is of interest
if you want to work on the core engine.

### Older, detailed documentation

Some slightly outdated information can be found below. While this isn't
completely up to date, we are hoping to convert and update these pages to the
current version soon. Nonetheless, many things are still valid in these
documents and may be useful to get started developing or modding Stratagus
games.

See
[development](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wargus/stratagus/master/doc/development.html)
for further details when wanting to help work on the engine.

Information about creating sounds and graphics can be found in the [media
documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wargus/stratagus/master/doc/media.html)

Information about Lua scripting to extend or mod games can be found in the
    [scripting
    documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wargus/stratagus/master/doc/scripts/index.html).
